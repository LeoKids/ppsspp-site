# System requirements

## PC (Windows, Linux, Mac)

PPSSPP is very efficient and can play most PSP games at great graphical quality on almost any PC or Mac hardware made in the last 10 years or even more. Do make sure to keep your graphics drivers up to date,and that your graphic drivers support OpenGL 2.0,DirectX 9,DirectX 11,and Vulkan.

## Android

Any Android device made in the last 10 years will be able to run PPSSPP, but performance will vary. Generally most newer devices that are not budget models will run all games without major performance issues.
